### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Luigi Ferraioli, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Mechatronics, following two Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical and Mechatronical Engineering. With a passion for robotics and automation, I specialize in ROS2, C++, and Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [Defacto research project](https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/defacto.html)
- ðŸ”¬ My previous project involved implementing an autonomous drone in the research project [5URVIVE](https://5urvive.de/). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to improve my skills in C++ and delve deeper into embedded systems.
- ðŸ’¬ I enjoy working with ROS2 and Gazebo, building digital twins that facilitate testing and implementing new technologies.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love experimenting with new robotic designs and tinkering with electronics in my free time!

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on exciting projects!
